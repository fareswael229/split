    <p>Split is a 2016 American psychological thriller film and the second installment in the Unbreakable trilogy and a
        "stealth sequel" to Unbreakable, written, directed and produced by M. Night Shyamalan, and starring James
        McAvoy, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Betty Buckley. The film follows a man with dissociative identity disorder who
        kidnaps and imprisons three teenage girls in an isolated underground facility.</p>
    <h1>the split characters:</h1>
    <h2>1. Kevin Wendell Crumb:</h2>
    <img src="./kevin.webp" alt="Kevin" id="kevin">
    <p>Kevin is the main character James McAvoy plays who has dissociative identity disorder.
        Through flashbacks in "Split," we learn Kevin's mother was abusive and suffered from obsessive-compulsive
        disorder (OCD). After Kevin's father mysteriously disappeared on a train one day, the young boy grew up
        suffering from abuse at the hands of his mother which caused Kevin to retreat into other personalities to
        protect him. We will see Kevin again in "Glass."</p>
    <h2>2.Barry S:</h2>
    <img src="./barry s.webp" alt="barry" id="barry">
    <p>Barry regularly visits a therapist, Dr. Fletcher, to keep the Horde in check. For a long time he was the identity
        in charge of which personalities could come out and take control of Kevin's body until he was overtaken by
        several others. Barry also has a deep understanding of fashion and design. We see him carry around a portfolio
        of sketches.
        Throughout the movie, he tries to send emergency emails to Dr. Fletcher to warn her about other, dangerous
        personalities taking control.</p>
    <h2>3.Dennis</h2>
    <img src="./dennis.webp" alt="dennis" id="dennis">
    <p>Dennis is the first of Kevin's other identities we're introduced to in "Split." At the start of the film, he
        kidnaps three teenage girls and asks one to dance for him. As the movie progresses, we learn he likes to watch
        young girls dance naked and, for that reason, the others try to keep him from emerging.
        Similar to Kevin's mother, Dennis has OCD and is obsessed with cleanliness. According to Dr. Fletcher's files
        briefly seen in "Split," Dennis is one of two caretakers of the group. The other is Patricia.</p>
    <h2>4.Ms. Patricia</h2>
    <img src="./mrs.webp" alt="mrs" id="ms">
    <p>Ms. Patricia is an orderly, older woman who tries to keep the other personalities in check. For the most part,
        she's a calm and polite motherly figure, but her perfectionism causes her to be considered unstable. This is
        best seen when Patricia gets upset after cutting a sandwich unevenly and needing to start over. </p>
    <h2>5.hedwig</h2>
    <img src="./hedwig.webp" alt="hedwig" id="hedwig">
    <p>The naive, nine-year-old child who can take control of Kevin's body whenever he wants. Hedwig befriends Casey
        while she's captured by Dennis in "Split" and he divulges that he's a big Kanye West fan along with a dancer. He
        often repeats several things over, including the fact that he has red socks.

        Most noticeable about Hedwig is that he speaks with a lisp. Expect to see more of him in "Glass."</p>
    <h2>6.jade</h2>
    <img src="./jade.webp" alt="jade" id="jade">
    <p>Jade is one of several identities we see appear on video logs. We're not given an age for the character, but she
        acts like a teen. (Her vlog is labeled with a heart next to her name.) Jade says she has diabetes and takes
        insulin shots to manage it.

        In "Glass," Jade flirts with Daryl at the psychiatric hospital as a means to try and escape.</p>
    <h2>7.Orwell</h2>
    <img src="./orwell.webp" alt="orwell" id="orwell">
    <p>Orwell is also one of the characters who appears on a video log before speaking briefly to Casey. He appears to
        be a historian, and is not in favor of unleashing the Beast.</p>
    <h2>8.the beast</h2>
    <img src="./beast.webp" alt="beast" id="beast">
    <p>Kevin's 24th personality first shows itself near the end of "Split" after Dennis leaves flowers for Kevin's
        father at a train station terminal. The Horde transforms into what they refer to as the Beast. He appears more
        physically built than Kevin and has the ability to climb walls, run quickly, and, near the film's end he bends
        steel bars. He also kills and eats two of the girls he kidnaps in "Split."

        A police report at the end of the movie claimed the beast's identity was a blend of animals from the
        Philadelphia zoo where Kevin worked. In "Glass," Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) wants to team up with the
        Beast.</p>
